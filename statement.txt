Statement
---------

For this assignment, I used an AI language model (ChatGPT, GPT-5) only for clarification and guidance, not for obtaining or copying final code. Specifically:

* Clarify the conceptual behaviour of a heap-based priority queue and ADT requirements

* Ask for high-level algorithmic explanations (e.g. up-heap / down-heap logic)

* Request code structure examples to understand common implementations

* I asked AI to explain concepts of hashing, collisions, buckets, map operations, BSTS, AVL, Graph basics, BFS/DFS, Topological Order.

* I asked AI for debugging.

* I asked AI to produce example test code to help me manually verify my own implementation.




All final code in my submission was written, checked, and understood by me.


All AI-influenced code that appears in the submitted source files has been reviewed and understood fully by me before inclusion
